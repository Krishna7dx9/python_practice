* **patterns/**: Logic building through pattern-based coding.
* **dsa/**: Implementations of data structures and algorithmic problems.

## 🎯 Goals
* Master Pythonic approaches for problem solving.
* Maintain consistent coding discipline.
* Build a well-organized DSA reference for interviews.

## 🛠️ Environment
* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **IDE**: PyCharm / VS Code
